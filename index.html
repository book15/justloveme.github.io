       <h2>Why you fightin' it?</h2>
        <p>You know it feels so good and like it supposed to be, so why you fight it? When we together, it feels so right,
      but when we apart, it just ain't right. You stay on my mind, but it can't just be me. I know deep down you want something
      so real, but something is stopping you from seeing that I am right in front of you. 
      Reaching out with open arms. But you turn around and walk away.
      It's time to stop playing, we been playing this game for long enough. 
      It could all be so simple...</p>
